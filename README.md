# Fraud-detection-in-Financial-Transcations

## 1. Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning system that can accurately detect fraudulent financial transactions. By analyzing transaction patterns and behaviors, the system will classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. This solution aims to assist financial institutions in reducing the impact of fraud, minimizing financial losses, and improving security measures.

- Key objectives include:

Identifying patterns in financial transactions that indicate fraud.
Developing both machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) models for prediction.
Building a user-friendly web application for real-time fraud detection.
